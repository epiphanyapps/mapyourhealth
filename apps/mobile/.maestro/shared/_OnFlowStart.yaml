# flow: Shared _OnFlowStart
#intent:
# launch the app with a completely clear state, wait for animations to settle,
# and click through the expo dev screens if needed.
# These conditionals slow the app launch down a little but are necessary because the expo
# dev server and launch screen are only shown when the new architecture is turned off in expo 53.
# So we check to see if we need to connect to the metro server... that loads the app and then we
# check if the dev menu is showing and dismiss it if necessary.
# Then the app is then launched and ready for the maestro tests to run.
#
# This flow should be included in every maestro test header as `onFlowStart` to ensure expo screens
# are bypassed if necessary. Example:
#
# appId: ${MAESTRO_APP_ID}
# onFlowStart:
#   - runFlow: ../shared/_OnFlowStart.yaml
# ---
# [your maestro flow]
#
appId: ${MAESTRO_APP_ID}
---
# launch the app with a clean slate
- launchApp:
    clearState: true
    clearKeychain: true
    stopApp: true

- waitForAnimationToEnd

# conditionally run the dev client flow if the words "Development servers" is present.
# this uses the default maestro timeout and moves on if it doesn't see the text.

    when:
      visible: 'Development servers'

# dismiss bottom sheet if Close button is visible (may not appear in newer Expo versions)
