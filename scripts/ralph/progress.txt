# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-17
Branch: ralph/safety-dashboard-mvp

## Codebase Patterns

(Add reusable patterns discovered during implementation)

- Mobile app uses Ignite template patterns - components in apps/mobile/app/components/
- Screens follow *Screen.tsx naming convention in apps/mobile/app/screens/
- Backend is AWS Amplify Gen2 in packages/backend/
- Use yarn workspaces - run commands from root or specific app directory

---

## Setup Notes

- Ralph configured for Claude Code (adapted from Amp version)
- PRD generated from GitHub issues at epiphanyapps/mapyourhealth
- Stories ordered by dependency: mock data → UI components → auth → backend features
- Each story links to GitHub issue via `githubIssue` field
